#this file contains all kinematic properties for building the kinematic chain in diy_robotarm_macro.xacro
#these params are extracted from cad and represent DH-params

#NOTE: don't change properties in this file, because they are related to the reference sets, defined in cad construction for the links (in our case DH-convention was used)
